# Material Alert Dialogs for Flutter ðŸ“±

A new Flutter package project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Android Library to implement *animated*, ðŸ¥° *Attractive*, ðŸŽ¨*stylish* Material Dialog in Flutter easily.

## Implementation
Implementation of Material Alert Dialog library is so easy. You can check [/app](/app) directory for demo. Let's have look on basic steps of implementation.

### Create AlertDialog Instance
As there are two types of dialogs in library. Material Dialogs are instantiated as follows.
#### i. MaterialAlertDialog
`MaterialDialog` class is used to create MaterialAlertDialog. Its static `Builder` class is used to instantiate it. 
```java
       showDialog(context: context, builder:(context)=>
       MaterialAlertDialog(

                      height: 250,

                      title: "Exit",

                      message: "Are you sure you want to quit",

                     onPresedPositiveButton: (){
                       //add what you want for navigate
                     },

                      onPresedNegativeButton: (){
                        Navigator.pop(context);
                      },

                   ),
               );
```

#### ii. MaterialAlertDialog
`AnimatedMaterialAlertDialog` class is used to create MaterialAlertDialog. Its static `Builder` class is used to instantiate it. 
```java
       showDialog(context: context, builder:(context)=>
       AnimatedMaterialAlertDialog(
                      
                      imagePath: "assets/steth.jpg"
                      
                      height: 250,

                      title: "Exit",

                      message: "Are you sure you want to quit",

                     onPresedPositiveButton: (){
                     
                       //add what you want for navigate
                       
                     },

                      onPresedNegativeButton: (){
                        Navigator.pop(context);
                      },

                   ),
               );
```
